This is the solution for the bonus exercise of turning LEDs on and off in a loop.

Note that the code for managing the state of the red and green LEDs are tied together in a single synchronous loop.  It would be ideal to tie these states to independant events or timers.  We will explore that in a future kata.

Note also that you can use CTRL-C to interrupt the program.  At that point you can interact with the REPL to turn LEDs on and off manually.

This is the last coding exercise we will do without first writing tests.
